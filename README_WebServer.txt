When using this project, first create a simple HTTP file. You can put whatever you please inside of it.

This is what you'll see when you launch the web server.

HOW TO RUN:
1.Make sure HTTP and WebServer1.py are in the same folder.
2.Run the WebServer until it shows the HTTP OK message.
3.Then open up the HTTP file in a web browser and it should show the message you put.
4.If not, then it should show a 404 error message.
